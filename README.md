<h1>Employee Management Database</h1>
Hey there! employee management database project using SQL. This project is designed to showcase my SQL skills and demonstrate my ability to design tables, insert data, and perform basic queries. Let's get started!.<br />



<h2>Step 1: Setting Up</h2>

First things first, I set up my environment. I installed MySQL to manage my database and created a new database named "EmployeeManagement."

<h2>Step 2: Designing the Tables</h2>
<p>Now, let's dive into designing the heart of our database â€“ the tables! I created two tables: "Employees" and "Departments." These tables will hold all the essential employee information. </p>

<h3>Employees Table:</h3>

<p>employee_id (Primary Key) </p>
<p>first_name </p>
<p>last_name </p>
<p>department_id (Foreign Key referencing Departments) </p>


<h3>Departments Table:</h3>

<p>department_id (Primary Key) </p>
<p>department_name </p>

<h2>Step 3: Inserting Sample Data</h2>
<p>
  With our tables ready, it's time to add some data to play around with. I inserted sample data into both the Employees and Departments tables.
</p>

<h3>Departments Table </h3>
